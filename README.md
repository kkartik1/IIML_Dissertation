# 📘 Dissertation Proposal  
## **Transformer-Based Models for Enhancing Payment Integrity in U.S. Healthcare**

---

## 🧠 Introduction  
U.S. healthcare processes over **5 billion claims annually**, with **improper payments exceeding $100 billion**. Traditional fraud detection methods—static rules and shallow models—fail to capture the semantic and sequential complexity of billing data.

Transformer models, originally designed for NLP, offer scalable, context-aware modeling for structured claims data. This proposal introduces a transformer-based framework to detect fraudulent and wasteful claim patterns with mathematical rigor, accuracy, and interpretability.

---

## 🚀 Motivation  
- Rule-based models lack generalization to new fraud patterns  
- Transformers model dependencies between fields like CPT codes, service dates, and provider IDs  
- The $9B payment integrity market is shifting toward generative and foundation models  
- This work tailors transformers for structured payer claims data—without relying on EHRs  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Adapt transformer models (e.g., RoBERTa, DistilBERT) to payer claim sequences  
- Formalize anomaly detection using optimization, complexity, and information theory  
- Evaluate on claims-only datasets for fraud types like duplicate claims, upcoding, phantom billing  
- Build interpretable and robust detection pipelines for real-world deployment  

---

## 🧪 Methodology  

### 📊 Data  
- CMS DE-SynPUF (synthetic Medicare claims)  
- Structured fields: CPT/ICD codes, provider IDs, amounts, dates  

### 🏗️ Model Design  
- Tokenize claim fields into embeddings  
- Fine-tune transformer encoders with positional and provider-aware layers  
- Model pairwise and time-series relationships to detect anomalies  

### 📐 Mathematical Tools  
- PAC-Bayes bounds for generalization guarantees  
- Eigenvalue analysis of attention weights  
- Perturbation testing for adversarial billing strategies  

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics  
- ROC-AUC, F1 Score, cost-savings simulations  
- Bootstrapping and cross-validation  
- Comparison against XGBoost and logistic regression baselines

## 🔍 Use Case: Duplicate Claims Detection  

### ❓ Problem  
Duplicate claims may differ in spelling, code order, or submission date—making exact matching unreliable.

### ⚙️ Traditional Methods  
- Rule-based matching on fields like provider ID, CPT/ICD code, date of service  
- Fuzzy matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance)  

### ❌ Limitations  
- High false negatives due to altered field values  
- High false positives from superficial similarity  

### ✅ Transformer-Based Solution  
```text
Claim A:
Procedure: 99213
Provider: Dr. Smith
Date: March 10, 2025
Diagnosis: "Follow-up for hypertension"
Note: "Patient returned for medication review"

Claim B:
Procedure: 99213
Provider: Dr. Smith
Date: March 10, 2025
Diagnosis: "High blood pressure"
Note: "Routine follow-up, reviewed meds"
```

Transformers embed both claims into the same semantic space and flag high contextual similarity.

---

## 🧠 Mathematical Viewpoint  
Transformers convert sequences into high-dimensional vectors. Similarity is computed via:

```math
Similarity = cosine(embedding_A, embedding_B)
```

This method captures latent meaning and multi-field interaction—far more robust than rule-based matching.
